# Blog Review Card 🤞
### - Peace be upon you. This was a small project and a fixed page that didn’t have much work, but I learned from it as usual.❤
### - Well, in brief, about the project, it was a task on the Front and Mentor website, and it required a simple card, as you can see.

### 👀 This is the link to the task on the site -> [This Task](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). 

## - What did you learn from the project?? 👀
1- position element in css 
  ``` position: absolute; ```

2- use border in CSS ``` box-shadow: 8px 8px 0px 0px; ```

3- cursor in CSS ex : ``` cursor: pointer;  ```
